fact,L-F,E-BS,glow,Florescence thing arch thing that glow like those bedroom star 
fact,L-F,E-H,laser,A laser is a hilly intense tool its all the tools 
explanation,L-E,E-S,shadow,A shadow is mad by an object in front of a light stream The light cant go around and then no light git be hind the objects and its dark 
fact,L-F,E-BS,shadow,An umbra is the dark shadow 
fact,L-F,E-BS,shadow,A penumbra is the light shadow 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,eclipse,A solar eclipse is an eclipse of the sun It occurs when the moon is located between the sun and the earth The moon blocks the sunlight coming to the earth 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,eclipse,A liner elicits is when the sun is behind the earth and the moons in front of the earth 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,travel,My theory is that light travels in waves I leaned this by doing an ensnarement the end resale was a wave pattern Like doping to pebbles in a pond and the reason is like light 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,travel,Light travels in inviable waves so it acts like a straight line but is actually waves 
fact,L-F,E-BS,refraction,Water bends light 
explanation,L-EE,E-H,travel,Light wave length is shorter then ultra violet waves which are inviable to our eyes so some people still think that light travels in a straight line It was proved by many people a long time ago 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,lens,Most lenses focuses light so if a weak but large source of light is being produced and you put a lens under it then it will make the weak light focus and become strong 
fact,L-F,E-BS,lens,Some lenses make light spread out 
fact,L-F,E-H,lens,there are many types of lenses there are glasses magnifying glasses and many many more 
explanation,L-EE,E-H,glow,Most glowing things are painted with a layer of fluorescent paint this paint absorbs light and when it is dark the absorbed light would unleash the light that it saved until its empty and has no more light 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,There are primary colors and secondary colors The primary colors of light are red blue and green 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,Red and green make yellow light 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,green and blue light make cyan 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,and red and blue make magenta

fact,L-F,E-BS,rainbow,Rainbows are light colors you can see 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,prism&rainbow,you make a rainbow with a prism if you put a source of light in front of a glass prism you usably don't see a perfect rainbow mane not even a rainbow but sometimes you can see a small rainbow
explanation,L-EE,E-H,rainbow,but that doesn't explain why sometimes there are rainbows after rain storms or when it rains the answer to this is raindrops act as prisms but when I did a experiment at my house i filled a glass of water and turned out the lights I didn't see even a tiny outline of a rainbow 
fact,L-EF,E-H,reflection,When light hits a flat mirror at a 20 degree angle it goes out of the flat mirror at a 20 degree angle this means the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence so light if it goes in at any number angle it will come out at the same angle but this only works with a flat mirror 
fact,L-F,E-BS,diffused,If you use it with aluminum foil thats all crumpled up then light will go out at all sides this is called a diffuse reflection 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,reflection,There are many types of mirrors there are flat mirrors which in the last paragraph is the only type of mirror that will make light go out at the same angle that it came in a flat mirror is the most comment mirror 
fact,L-F,E-BS,reflection,but there are two more basic ones One is the concave mirror This mirror looks like a cave It goes in and bounces light inside it 
fact,L-F,E-BS,reflection,Unlike convex mirrors convex mirrors can bounce off many sides Those are the basic mirrors 
fact,L-F,E-H,diffused,If a shiny thing like tin foil is there but bent the law of reflection doesn't work The light goes all over the place 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,reflection,Convex mirrors make your vision all you can see in the area bigger so if you look in a convex mirror you will see a lot more behind you thees are used in places like cars 
explanation,L-E,E-H,shadow,A shadow is made by an opaque object nontransparent object and when you shine the light through the opaque object you can see a black spot that black spot is a shadow 
fact,L-F,E-BS,shadow,there are two parts of a shadow a umbra dark part which is in the middle and penumbra light part is on the outside part 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,eclipse,There are two types of eclipses The rift one is called a solar eclipse Its when the moon goes in front of the earth and behind the sun which casts a shadow upon earth As I said before an opaque object like the moon and the sun is the light source it makes a shadow 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,eclipse,a lunar eclipse is the opiate of a solar eclipse a lunar eclipse is when the earth goes in front of the moon the earth is also opaque but the shadow this time is bigger 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,see,Your eyes cant fully adjust to the dark but they can a bit my eyes have never fully adjusted to the dark but I have had light near and it was dark because I was near a lot of light then it suddenly changes my body wont react too fast but it can wait a few seconds and it will think I have Benn there long enough but with no light I don't think your eyes can adjust to a perfectly dark room 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,laser,Lasers are a very very strong source of light they are so hot that they can cut through metal bars with ease diamond sellers cut Simmonds which is one of the hardest substances on earth  
fact,L-F,E-BS,materials,Opaque transparent and translucent are some terms in light Opaque means that its non see through 
fact,L-F,E-BS,materials,Translucent means that some light can go through but not all so part see through 
fact,L-F,E-BS,materials,Transparent means full SE through so nontransparent means opaque non SEe through 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,objects,If light hits a red rose red gets reflected and blue and green get absorbed thats why we see red 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,objects,but with a yellow rose green and red get reflected and blue gets absorbed because red and green make yellow 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,northern,Aura Borealis commonly none as the northern lights are a form of colored light is usual found in the north pole but it can go south like to France or Italy The natives feared them because they thought they were evil things 
explanation,L-EE,E-H,sunpanel,Solar panels are usably used in places where they want to absorb light what a solar panel is basically is a thing that absorbs light stead of reflecting light so it can give off light later on 
fact,L-F,E-BS,bio,Photoluminescence is when an animal makes it one light FACT over 70 of the worlds deep sea fish are photoluminescence fireflies are also photoluminescence 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,postimage,You have three eye cones in your eyes to SEe different couplers like I said before the easy way to SE many couplers is you need blue red and green so they are blue red and green 
explanation,L-E,E-H,glow,glowing things is that it needs to absorb light to work 
fact,L-F,E-H,glow,To see a white shrift glow you need purple light 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,bio,photoluminescence is when creatures in small dark places can make them selfs viable for example fire flies have photoluminescence and their is this kind of fish that has a little light on its head 
fact,L-F,E-BS,glow,chemiluminescence is the chemical that make things glow 
fact,L-F,E-BS,glow,Fluorescence is the process of demitting light while receiving energy from another source 
fact,L-F,E-BS,laser,Lasers are very highly bright and intense light  They can burn though anything 
explanation,L-E,E-H,shadow,A shadow is a reflection of light hitting an object To see a shadow you need a source of light like the sun or a flash light 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,shadow,here is a example of umbra and penumbra when you put an easer under a flash light the black shadow is the umbra and the gray shadow is the penumbra 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,eclipse,A lunar eclipse is when the moon over laps the sun and blackens out the sky so no one ca see the sun and the sun and the moon turn black 
explanation,L-E,E-H,eclipse,A solar eclipse is when the sun over laps the moon band then the sun and the moon go red 
explanation,L-E,E-H,shadow,This is how a shadow is made  a shadow is made when light hits an object 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,the primary colors of light are  Green Red and Blue 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,postimage,those are the colors of your eye cones What I mean by your eye cones is you have eye cones is that you have cones in your eyes that are shaped like ice cream cones by mixing them you get the Secondary colors 
fact,L-EF,E-S,pri&sec,The Secondary colors of light are made by mixing the Primary colors of light here are the Secondary colors of light  Yellow Magenta and Cyan here is how their made  
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,Yellow is made by mixing Green and Red  
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,Magenta is made by Blue and Red 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,and Cyan is made by blue and Green 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,This is how we see white we mix  Red Blue and Green all together make white 
explanation,L-EE,E-H,object,What is absorbing My understanding is that when white light hits a red object all the colors that make white  Red Green and Blue blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed 
explanation,L-EE,E-H,object,What is Reflecting My understanding is like before we have a red dress when white light hits the red dress blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed Why I think there reflected is because its not the same color 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,object,this is how we can see a red rose white light hits the rose red is reflected and blue and green are absorbed and the rose papers upside down and back wards but your brain turns it to the right way 
explanation,L-EE,E-H,object,this is how we see a yellow rose the white light hits the rose green and red are reflected and blue is absorbed why green and red are reflected incited of just one color is because yellow is a secondary color and are brain sees the rose upside down and backwards 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,prism&rainbow,This is why how you make a rainbow with a prism you get a prism and shine a light though the prism and then you will see a prism rainbow
fact,L-EF,E-BS,northern,the Northern lights are branches of colored light in the sky you can only see them in the north pole but some times you can see them in muskox in the winter 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,rainbow,how we make a rainbow with rain  After it rains you see a rainbow its made by the sun light shining though the water and it makes a rainbow 
fact,L-F,E-BS,materials,A transparent object is something you can see though like Stephanie light can go right though it 
fact,L-F,E-BS,materials,A translucent object is some thing that you can kind of see though like paper paper is sort of dark sort of light  
fact,L-F,E-BS,materials,An opaque object is something that you cant see though at all like a base ball or a baseball bat 
fact,L-F,E-BS,reflection,A concave mirror is a mirror that has cave the image looks like your head is bent 
fact,L-F,E-BS,reflection,A convex mirror is something that looks like somebodies belly The image looks like your head is bent out ward 
fact,L-F,E-BS,reflection,The law of relation is when the angle of incandescence  the angle of reflection 
fact,L-F,E-BS,infused,When light hits a bumpy surface its rays are reflected every where  
fact,L-F,E-H,lens,A double concave lens is a magnifying glass lens when light gos though it it soots out every where 
fact,L-F,E-BS,camera,On a camera there is a convex lens to help focus the light when the light gos though the lens it gets concertinaed  
explanation,L-E,E-BS,sunpanel,Solar panel absorb light and change it to solar energy 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,travel,My theory about how light travels is that light travels in ripple waves 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,see,My theory about all we see is light is that every thing we see is light 
fact,L-F,E-BS,shadow,My understanding of shadows are that shadows are always on the other side of the light source 
fact,L-F,E-H,shadowsize,The closer you get to the light the bigger your shadow gets 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,shadow,When you have two light sources facing on one thing and there turned on you see two shadows And the same thing happens when you have three light sources are there but three shadows appear 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,shadow,the way a shadow is made is that you are covering part of where the light hits 
fact,L-F,E-BS,shadow,and the complete black area is called umbra 
fact,L-F,E-BS,shadow,and where its Grey is called penumbra 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,eclipse,New information A lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon Since the earth is in front of the moon it castes a shadow over the moon making it in total darkness 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,eclipse,A solar eclipse is when the moon casts a show over the earth and its just like a lunar eclipse precept what I just told you 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,prism&rainbow,If you add light to a prism it should change the white light into the colors of the rainbow Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Violet and Indigo
explanation,L-E,E-BS,rainbow,My understanding of rainbows is that the reason that there always in the same order is that Red has the longest light wave and violet the shortest 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,My understanding of the primary colors of light are Red Green and Blue 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,but the primary colors of pigment are Yellow Blue and Red 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,Blue and Green makes cyan 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,Red and Blue makes magenta 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,and Red and Green makes yellow 
fact,L-F,E-BS,pri&sec,Of course if you were in pigment yellow would be green 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,objects,The way we see a red rose is that white light contains the primary coleus of light red blue and green What happens is that the red light hitting a red rose the red light bounces off and into our eyes and the other colors get absorbed 
explanation,L-E,E-H,objects,With a yellow ors its pretty much the same thing but 2 colors don't get absorbed they mix and bounce off as one ray 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,objects,Anything that isn't the same color gets absorbed the same color is always reflected 
fact,L-F,E-S,postimage,Every person has eye cones that are sensitive to a servant color Each eye con is sensitive to either red blue or green 
fact,L-EF,E-H,postimage?,Try clewing one eye then switching one eye looks more red the other more blue since we don't have a third eye we see blue and red and not green because in pigment its replaced with yellow 
fact,L-F,E-BS,Northern,The northern light are the color red eerie green and pink 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,northern,The northern lights are cosed by partials from the sun The particles are so small you couldn't see them How they acute is when the particles hit highest thing of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air making it glow 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,rainbow,Rainbows are sometimes made when leftover raindrops The raindrops acts as prisms 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,bio,My understanding of natural and artificial light is that living things make there own light like fireflies squids bacteria and fungi 70 present of the worlds deep sea fish make their own light 
fact,L-F,E-BS,glow,chemiluminescence is when chemicals make things glow like luminescent paint 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,glow,other things make things glow in the dark like electricity heat and friction 
fact,L-F,E-BS,glow,Fluorescence is when something is giving off light while getting energy from another source 
fact,L-F,E-BS,laser,Lasers can burn through the hardest substance like diamonds the hardest things on earth Laser can burn thousands of holes in 1 day 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,materials,My understanding of transparent objects is that if you look at it you should see through it roughly A transparent object is usually like a window some toys and glass 
fact,L-EF,E-S,reflection,The law of reflection is that if you shine light at a 90 degree angle it will be reflected as a 90 degree angle the light ray that egos to the flat mirror is called the incident ray and the ray that bounces off is called reflected ray 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,diffused,Diffused reflection is when a ray of light comes and hits something like bumpy tinfoil The light comes and egos everywhere because it has more than one thing to bounce off of it It egos up down right left because when its bumpy it goes like that because of different bumps 
fact,L-F,E-PS,materials,Opaque is a thing that you can see and see through but its fuzzy An opaque object is like plastic 
fact,L-F,E-PS,reflection,a concave mirror when light is shown into it reflects the light all around and then up 
fact,L-F,E-BS,reflection,its used in things like flashlights if we didn't use concave mirrors in flashlights it would be like a candle 
fact,L-F,E-BS,lens,Convex lens with light rays will concentrate light making a focus point that is the most concentrated and after that it starts to get less concentrated 
fact,L-F,E-BS,sunpanel,Solar panels can make lots of things do stuff 
explanation,L-E,E-PS,reflection,If you looked into a concave mirror you would see behind you and a lot of light because the light goes in then bounces until it shoots out the way it came 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,reflection,Convex mirrors are used in stores They let you see around corners and stuff ltd shaped like a ball with the top cut off the way it lets you see around corners is it does everything but catch light so it bounces off as an angle 
fact,L-F,E-BS,materials,Translucent object let some light but not all light through So translucent would be like frosted glass or clouds 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,object,All we see is light the way I can prove it is that the same color light bounces off things that are supposed to be that color Then the color bounces into your eye Three primary colors are in white light so if you mix those you'll get any color 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,eclipse,I learned that a solar eclipse occurs when the moon blocks the sun which casts a huge shadow over the earth 
fact,L-F,E-BS,materials,I also learned that light can not go through an opaque object because it isn't transparent 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,sundial,Another one of the things I learned was that in ancient times people used sundials to tell the time They could tell that the higher the sun was in the sky the shorter the shadow 
explanation,L-EE,E-S,eclipse,I just learned that a lunar eclipse occurs when the earth is between the sun and the moon The earth is in front of the moon and behind the sun which makes a huge shadow over the moon 
fact,L-F,E-BS,shadow,An umbra is a small light source that makes a dark shadow 
fact,L-F,E-BS,shadow,A penumbra is a lighter shadow 
explanation,L-E,E-H,shadow,A shadow is made by light hitting you and the light is big so it gets around the person and makes a shadow 
fact,L-F,E-H,shadowsize,Also the farther you walk away the longer your shadow will get 
fact,L-F,E-BS,lens,When light hits a double concave lens unlike the double convex the light will go further apart 
fact,L-F,E-BS,lens,When light hits a double convex lens it travels together and hits and the light is concentrated at the focal point 
fact,L-F,E-H,lens,I learned that a magnifying glass can focus the light more than it can when the light is just by itself 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,electric,I also learned that there are things called atoms and electrons that can pass through wires and make electricity 
fact,L-F,E-S,bio,Another thing I learned was that 70 of the worlds sea fish use photoluminescence to make themselves glow 
fact,L-F,E-BS,bio,Photoluminescence is when a animal gives of its own light 
fact,L-F,E-BS,glow,Fluorescence is when something gives of light while receiving it from somewhere else 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,laser,Lasers are very bright and they can burn through anything in the world It can burn through steel and chrome and cloth and iron and metal and everything 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,The primary colors of light are  red blue and green 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,And blue green and red make the color white 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,The secondary colors of light are yellow magenta and cyan 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,northern,The northern lights happen when the sun makes tiny bits of electricity go down to earth

fact,L-F,E-S,rainbow,The colors of the rainbow are red antidisestablishmentarianism and violet 
fact,L-F,E-BS,postimage,There are three kinds cones in your eyes red blue and green 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,objects,If you look at a yellow flower the color that would absorb is blue and the colors that would bounce into your eyes are red and green 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,objects,If you look at a red rose blue and green are absorbed into your eyes and red is reflected 
fact,L-F,E-H,rainbow,A spectrum is another name for a rainbow 
fact,L-F,E-BS,prism&rainbow,When white light goes through a prism it will make a rainbow All the colors that come out of the prism will be rainbow colors
fact,L-F,E-BS,northern,The northern lights are originally located in the north pole And some Eskimo called Inuits thought the northern lights were evil 
fact,L-F,E-BS,materials,A transparent object is something see through like a ghost or glass 
fact,L-F,E-BS,materials,Translucent means that only a little light can get through for example frosty glass and tracing paper 
fact,L-F,E-BS,materials,Opaque means that no light can get through for instance a cow is opaque and a chair is opaque 
fact,L-F,E-BS,reflection,A concave mirror is pushed in 
fact,L-F,E-BS,reflection,and a convex mirror is pushed out 
fact,L-F,E-BS,lens,Some television screens in the 50s were convex screens 
fact,L-F,E-S,reflection,If light comes in on a 45 degree angle on a flat mirror it will come out on a 45 degree angle 
fact,L-F,E-BS,diffused,On the other hand if light goes in on a 45 degree angle on a bumpy mirror it will come out all crazy 
explanation,L-EE,E-S,rainbow,This is how rainbows are made with rain The sky is still moist and there are drops in the air which can be used like prisms so if the left over raindrops can be used like prisms then the light can shine through it to make a rainbow 
explanation,L-EE,E-S,sunpanel,Here is how solar panels work Dull dark surfaces do not reflect much light The dark surfaces absorb the suns rays and turn the rays into thermal energy The thermal energy is turned into heated water and then it is pumped into a storage tank and goes out through a fan That means that black attracts heat 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,glow,Chemiluminescence turns chemical energy into light I used to have glowing stars and a moon on the top of my closet so that is an example of chemiluminescence 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,travel,I think light travels in a straight line because the shadows prove that they travel straight or else the shadows would be wobbly 
fact,L-F,E-BS,rainbow,The colors of light is the rainbow 
explanation,L-E,E-PS,rainbow,When you see a rainbow  you only see half of it A rainbow is actual a circle but the clouds are blocking the half of the rainbow that you don't see 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,rainbow,Making a rainbow with rain is when its raining lightly and the sun is out An example is when you turn on a sprinkler and the sun is shining 
explanation,L-EE,E-H,electric,this is my picture of a light bulb a light bulb is made out of glass and artificial light The glass is to couscous the light to the spot you would like it and the artificial light is from the energy in the air that comes from your wall When you plug in a light a computer or anything that has a plug the energy goad through whores that travel over our hes and under us These 2 things are all plugd into a wall 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,prism,The picture I drew was making a rainbow out of a prism This picture is with two prisms this is how it works If you shine a light on a prism a rainbow will appear but if you put another prism in front of the other prism the light will turn white again This is How to make white light through a viable spectrum 
explanation,L-E,E-H,objects,If you look at a red rose in green light the rose doesn't absorb the green light so the rose appears black 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,objects,If you look at a red rose in magenta light the magenta light red and blue hits the red surface The color red is reflected But the color blue is absorbed then the rose appears red 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,the primary colors are red green and blue 
fact,L-EF,E-S,reflection,when light hits a flat mirror the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection When an incident ray hits a 40 degree angle it will come out a 40 degree angle 
fact,L-F,E-BS,diffused,Diffused reflection is when a light goad to wards a bumpy mirror and bounces in all directions 
fact,L-F,E-BS,materials,A transparent object is see through A prism is transparent and a peace of glass is transparent 
fact,L-F,E-BS,materials,An opaque object is not see through a brick book computer pencil and a tooth are all not see through 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,materials,A translucent object is not see through That means that you cant look through it But a little light can come through A translucent object can be a pace of paper and an mica computer 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,reflection,A concave mirror has a sort of cave shape We have mirrors that are flat the mirror that I am talking about is that mirror but pushed in This mirror looks like a bowl When you look into it you see a long shape of yourself 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,reflection,a convex mirror is the very opposite This mirror is pushed out This mirror looks like a belly As we gr 4 call it a belly mirror when you look into one of these mirrors you see yourself up side down 
fact,L-F,E-BS,lens,concave lens heal near sided people see far sided The light rays goad through the eyes and connect at the back of the head 
fact,L-F,E-BS,lens,The convex lens is the very opposite This is to heal far sided people see near sided

explanation,L-EE,E-BS,objects,When we look at a red rose the red eye cone color bounces off into our eye and the other two colors absorb so you see the color of the rose 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,objects,When we see a yellow rose blue would absorb and green and red would bounce off into our eye which makes yellow 
fact,L-F,E-BS,materials,A transparent object is clear and lets 100 light pass through 
fact,L-F,E-BS,materials,A translucent object is clear swell but only lets 50 go through 
fact,L-F,E-BS,materials,An opaque object lets 0 through 
fact,L-F,E-BS,reflection,The law of reflection on a flat mirror is The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection 
explanation,L-EE,E-S,travel,When we had the class debate I was the only student who was not on a side because my theory was light travels in waves but the waves go in a strait line and the debate was between straight line and waves And now we have lots of ideas from the debate and we don't know which one is right now is light travels sort of like this Light travels in a straight line but appears to be wavy or light travels in waves but appears to be straight That means that light has aspects of both straight lines and waves It depends on how you look at it Or what your experiment is trying to prove In our class we have seen experiments that prove both that light travels in straight lines box with powder and shadow experiments and wavy lines Thomas Young experiment 
explanation,L-EE,E-H,pri&sec,My understanding of Light The colors of light Light is made up of many many different colors You cannot see those colors because those colors mixed together to get white light White light is transparent so you cant see it 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,rainbow,When it rains the raindrops split the light so you can see 7 discolored orange yellow green blue indigo and violet that make a rainbow 
explanation,L-EE,E-S,objects,The way you see what color everything is is because of light hitting your eye when their is a green leaf the light hits it before it splits up it is called white light the green leaf absorbs the other colors but the green keeps going because it is the same color The green light keeps going until it goes into your eye Then the brain identifies what color and it is 
fact,L-F,E-BS,postimage,Cones are things that respond to colored light There are three kinds of light that cones respond to Red blue and green 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,postimage,Cones tire easily If you were looking at a green apple the cone that responds to green light gets tired So when you look at a piece of white paper the green cone would be to tired but the red and blue wouldn't and red and blue make purple And purple is the opposite of green on the color wheel 
fact,L-F,E-BS,prism,Light is the colors of the rainbow compressed to make white light A prism splits up light into separate colorsred orange yellow green blue indigo violet 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,rainbow,This is why the colors of the rainbow are in the same order As you know there are seven colors that we know of They all travel at a the same wave frequency and they get mixed But when light goes through something like rain the frequency of the light waves get differed For some reason red always has the longest frequency and purple has the shortest 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,pri&sec,There are different names for the colors of light Those names are the primary colors of light and the secondary colors of light There not just named orally The primary colors are the first colors that make up the secondary colors 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,The primary colors are red blue and green The same colors as your eye cones 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,The secondary colors are yellow cyan and magenta yellow indigo and purple 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,Red and blue make magenta 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,Blue and green make cyan and 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,green and red make yellow 
fact,L-F,E-S,pri&sec,All three primary colors make white 
explanation,L-E,E-BS,objects,That is why when you look at a yellow thing the red and green light bounce of it but blue gets absorbs mixes and comes to your eye as yellow 
explanation,L-EE,E-BS,northern,A thing that involves color and is very magnificent is the northern lights This happens because of magnetic disturbances of the sun The sun sends out particles of electricity that are microscopic The earths atmosphere makes the air electrified and then it glow The colors that glow are red pink and green 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,reflection,Light and materials The most useful materials to use in experiments about light are lenses and mirrors But first mirrors There are two kinds of mirrors There names are concave and convex 
fact,L-F,E-S,reflection,A convex mirror is shaped like a belly and a concave mirror is shaped like a cave 
fact,L-F,E-S,reflection,A concave mirror concentrates the light and a convex mirror does the opposite 
fact,L-EF,E-S,reflection,A convex mirror since it spreads the light out lets you see more of the stuff behind you A concave mirror since it concentrates light lets you see close up Concave mirrors are used by doctors to see up close 
fact,L-F,E-BS,reflection,You cant forget flat mirrors There sort of in the middle Flat mirrors are pretty important to 
fact,L-EF,E-S,reflection,They also have something called the law of reflection The law of reflection is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection To clarify that if light hits a flat mirror at say a 75 degree angle it is going to come off the mirror at a 75 degree angle 
fact,L-F,E-H,reflection,That law only works for smooth mirrors though 
fact,L-F,E-BS,diffused,On bumpy mirrors the reflected ray would go in all directions That is a called a diffused reflection 
fact,L-F,E-BS,lens,Now lenses There are two kinds of lenses Concave and convex Just like the mirrors they do the same things 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,lens,You can add another lens to one of those lenses also A double concave lens would spread out the light and a double convex would concentrate the light 
fact,L-F,E-S,lens,Lenses are transparent 
fact,L-F,E-S,materials,There are two other forms that Translucent and opaque 
fact,L-F,E-BS,materials,A transparent object means see through 
fact,L-F,E-H,materials,a translucent object colors the light and 
fact,L-F,E-S,materials,an opaque object means that it stops the light completely

explanation,L-EE,E-S,shadow,A shadow is the darkness on the other side of an opaque object whits is nontransparent When a light shines on an opaque object the light cant get around it so there is only darkness whits is a shadow 
fact,L-F,E-BS,shadow,There are two different ways you can play with shadows One is an umbra and the other is a penumbra 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,shadow,And umbra is made when you shine a light source over an object that is bigger than the light source That makes a big shadow that is pretty darker 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,shadow,A penumbra is when you shine a light source on something that is smaller than the light source That makes a little umbra and a penumbra which is lighter 
fact,L-EF,E-BS,eclipse,Those are the small the things to do with shadows but there are much bigger things Those things are eclipses There are two eclipses that we know of Solar and lunar

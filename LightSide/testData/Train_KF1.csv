64,4513,10/3/12,Leyden Jar,"u79,u97,u86",,"Speed matters. The slower you rub the tube with the fur, the shock will be much bigger. Why does this happen?I think that if it is rubbed slowly there are more crackles and crackles = static electricity.I used the leyden jar to power a light bulb but it work. My theory is that it didn't work because rubbing a tube and some fur isn't as strong as a battery. I thought it would work because rubbing the tube and the fur would create static electricity and the sucks the power in to move the wire. And when you touch it, it's like an escape to the light which lights it up. But I don't understand why it didn't work a little.I think that the leyden jar holds electricity so when you rub the tube with fur close to the nail, the nail picks up electricity and when you touch it you get a shock.The slower you rub it the bigger the shock. I think that happens because more electricity rushes to the top and into the nail. I think the electricity goes through the nail, through the wire, through the tape and back up when you touch it.Question: I wonder why you have to touch both the tin foil tape and the nail?Question: Why do you have to touch the tape first?",1,1,1,

66,4522,10/3/12,Lightbulb and foil tape,"u82,u86,u95,u79,u97",,"- If you put a battery on the foil tape with a light bulb the bulb will light up but only if the connection is strong.  So the tape may be acting as wires, that's why there need to be 2 pieces of tape to transmit the negative and positive energy. I tried putting the light bulb and battery on the same piece of foil and it did not work. - If you're going to have more than one battery, the positive and negative sides have to be matching. I think the reason why the electrical tape works is because it has something in it which helps the electrical tape carry the electricity over like wires do.- I think that when the battery touches the tape the electricity flows to the light bulb. When you add more light bulb the other light bulbs take the electricity and that is why it gets dimmer. i think it's because the tape doesn't let a lot of electricity flow so it makes it easy to get dim. I think that it doesn't work when there is something in the middle because it stops it from flowing. It just goes in a circle so it won't reach the light bulb.Question: I wonder if it would work if you only use one piece of tape and put everything on its side.",1,1,1,

I think the iron doesn't clump because there's no pressure on it. The fork works as a magnet, this happens because of the electricity running through the metal fork that attracts metal objects. When we tried with 6 volts it didn't work that well, so we did it with 12 volts and it worked perfectly.Why does a magnet need a positive and negative side? Are magnets the only thing that attracts iron?",1,1,1,

When you soak the paper towel in the lemon juice the lemon juice gets all over everything else so maybe the electrons are spreading too. Then once the electrons get all over everything else it becomes a negative charge. So the tube that has all the stuff in it doesn't have any positive charge and it needs both.
